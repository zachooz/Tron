    """
    This function should:
    - search through the asp using alpha-beta pruning
    - cut off the search after cutoff_ply moves have been made.

    Inputs:
        asp - an AdversarialSearchProblem
        cutoff_ply- an Integer that determines when to cutoff the search
            and use eval_func.
            For example, when cutoff_ply = 1, use eval_func to evaluate
            states that result from your first move. When cutoff_ply = 2, use
            eval_func to evaluate states that result from your opponent's
            first move. When cutoff_ply = 3 use eval_func to evaluate the
            states that result from your second move.
            You may assume that cutoff_ply > 0.
        eval_func - a function that takes in a GameState and outputs
            a real number indicating how good that state is for the
            player who is using alpha_beta_cutoff to choose their action.
            You do not need to implement this function, as it should be provided by
            whomever is calling alpha_beta_cutoff, however you are welcome to write
            evaluation functions to test your implemention
